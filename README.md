`JIGSAW(GEO)` is a set of algorithms designed to generate unstructured grids for geoscientific modelling. Applications include: large-scale atmospheric simulation and numerical weather prediction, global and coastal ocean-modelling, and ice-sheet dynamics. 

`JIGSAW(GEO)` can be used to produce high-quality 'generalised' Delaunay / Voronoi tessellations for unstructured finite-volume / element type models. Grids can be generated in local two-dimensional domains, and over general spheroidal surfaces. Mesh resolution can be adapted to follow complex user-defined metrics, including: topographic contours, discrete solution profiles or coastal features. These features enable the generation of complex, multi-resolution climate process models, with simulation fidelity enhanced in regions of interest.

`JIGSAW(GEO)` is a stand-alone mesh generator written in `c++`, based on <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw">`JIGSAW`</a> - a general purpose meshing package. This toolbox provides a <a href="https://www.python.org/">`Python`</a> based interface, including `file I/O`, `mesh visualisation` and `post-processing` facilities. The underlying `JIGSAW` library is a collection of unstructured triangle- and tetrahedron-based meshing algorithms, designed to produce high quality Delaunay-based grids for computational simulation. `JIGSAW` includes both Delaunay-refinement based algorithms for the construction of new meshes, as well as optimisation driven methods for the improvement of existing grids. 

`JIGSAW(GEO)` is typically able to produce the very high-quality staggered unstructured grids required by contemporary unstructued general circulation models (i.e. <a href="https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Release">`MPAS`</a>, <a href="https://research.csiro.au/cem/software/ems/hydro/unstructured-compas/">`COMPAS`</a>, <a href="http://fesom.de/">`FESOM`</a>, <a href="https://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/icon-esm/">`ICON`</a>, etc), generating highly optimised, multi-resolution meshes that are `locally-orthogonal`, `mutually-centroidal` and `self-centred`.

`JIGSAW(GEO)` has been compiled and tested on various `64-bit` `Linux` , `Windows` and `Mac` based platforms. 

## `Getting Started`

The first step is to compile and configure the underlying `JIGSAW` `c++` library. `JIGSAW` can either be built directly from src, or installed using the <a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jigsaw">`conda`</a> package manager. More details can be found <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw">here</a>. 


## `Example Problems`

After downloading and building the code, navigate to the root `JIGSAW(GEO)` directory to run the set of examples contained in `example.py`:
````
example(1); % simple 2-dim. examples to get stated.
example(2); % a multi-resolution grid for the Australian region.
example(3); % a multi-part grid of the (contiguous) USA.
example(4); % a uniform-resolution spheroidal grid.
example(5); % a spheroidal grid with a regional "patch".
example(6); % a spheroidal grid with complex grid-spacing constraints.
